# Area-Selective Deposition (ASD) Fundamentals

## Definition and Overview
Area-selective deposition (ASD) refers to any chemical or physical process that controllably forms a desired material layer on a desired "growth" region of an exposed surface without forming a layer on other adjacent "nongrowth" areas of different compositions or surface terminations.

## Key Concepts
- **Growth vs. Nongrowth Regions**: ASD processes are usually identified by how the reactants adsorb and react on these regions.
- **Surface Termination**: A critical part of the overall ASD process. Materials including metal oxides, nitrides, organics, and semiconductors require terminal species, such as hydrogen, hydroxyl, amine, or methyl groups to stabilize and maintain a "clean" surface.
- **Selectivity Loss**: Refers to a point or range in time when a process transitions from selective to blanket deposition.

## ASD Approaches
1. **Top-Down Approach**: Starts with a uniform blanket dielectric and metal films and uses a patterned photoresist to remove material from regions where the blanket film is not wanted.
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Works to deposit or create material only in regions where it is needed, avoiding the need for material removal.

## Enhancement and Passivation Mechanisms
- **Localized Enhancement**: Can be achieved using patterned surface excitation via electron, ion, or photon beams.
- **Passivation**: Can be achieved by adsorbing molecule monolayers or protective polymers.
- Ideally, the process that enhances or inhibits nucleation will be selective, so that it occurs only on regions where it is desired without modifying other regions.

## Historical Development
- Early motives for ASD included reducing masking steps in device preparation.
- Epitaxial silicon and GaAs were observed to grow on silicon at 700°C without depositing on an adjacent metal oxide.
- Area-selective epitaxy of silicon-based materials by CVD at temperatures in the range of 700-1200°C is well developed for "front-end" processing in transistors.

## ASD Methods
1. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)**
2. **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)**
3. **Molecular Layer Deposition (MLD)**
4. **Area-Selective ALD**: Most recent studies focus on this approach

## Applications
- Microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing
- Nanoscale patterning
- Bottom-up filling of interconnect structures
- Directed self-assembly of block copolymers

## Challenges
- Extending preparation to features with very small size or complex shapes
- Scaling surface preparation to large areas
- Maintaining high throughput
- Achieving selectivity at lower temperatures (<400°C)

## Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Phase-selective deposition**: Process to isolate a specific phase of a material or form different phases simultaneously in different regions
- **Facet-selective deposition**: Film formation on a preselected exposed crystal face, without reaction on neighboring crystal planes
- **Direction-selective deposition**: Growth proceeding only in one desired direction

## Importance in Semiconductor Industry
ASD is rapidly becoming a required tool to pattern and align nanometer-scale material elements in large wafer semiconductor manufacturing, particularly as device dimensions approach 5 nm or less.
